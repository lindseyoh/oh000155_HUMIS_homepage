# Lindsey Oh - HUMIS Project Notes
<p>Best viewed at around 75% width</p>
<p>The HUMIS project was a great way to get into web development for the first time! We learned how to use HTML, CSS, and also learned standard web development practices to create our very first site.</p>
<p>I also added some of my own code (after googling things on the internet). I hope that is alright!</p>
